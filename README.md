This project starter out as the demographic data analyzer project from the Data Analysis with Python certification from freecodecamp. I copied the main code that made the tests pass, but now that I have it in GitHub I'm going to tinker with both the data it is pulling from, the stats that it pulls, and the visual output of the data.
